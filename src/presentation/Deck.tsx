          React Is Killing Your Performance And It's Your Fault üöÄ
        </Heading>
        <Notes>
          by "it's your fault" - React is very fast and performant. It's used
          everywhere in very complex applications. If you encounter performance
          issues it's helpful to understand what React does and the design
          principles, so you don't shoot you own foot.

            At runtime, React makes sure that what we told it to do, is actually

        <Notes>
          Components have a render function (or are render functions themselves
          in case of Function Components) They produce elements Which make up
          the "Virtual DOM" (again, this term is not quite accurate since we can
          render other stuff than the DOM)

          We are not going to talk about DOM optimizations, painting, layouting
          etc. We are focusing on the reconciliation optimizations, but usually
          the DOM ones are the most expensive
